# Feature Engineering - Art of Creating Features üõ†Ô∏è

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy.

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. Feature Scaling
- Standardization (Z-score normalization)
- Min-Max scaling
- Robust scaling
- Log transformation
- Power transformation (Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson)

### 2. Encoding Categorical Variables
- Label encoding
- One-hot encoding
- Target encoding
- Frequency encoding
- Binary encoding
- Ordinal encoding

### 3. Handling Missing Values
- Deletion methods
- Imputation techniques (mean, median, mode)
- Forward/backward fill
- KNN imputation
- Iterative imputation

### 4. Feature Creation
- Polynomial features
- Interaction features
- Domain-specific features
- Date/time features
- Text features (TF-IDF, Count vectors)

### 5. Feature Selection
- Filter methods (correlation, chi-square, mutual information)
- Wrapper methods (RFE, forward/backward selection)
- Embedded methods (L1/L2 regularization, tree-based)
- Feature importance

### 6. Dimensionality Reduction
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- t-SNE
- UMAP
- Autoencoders

### 7. Outlier Detection
- Z-score method
- IQR method
- Isolation Forest
- Local Outlier Factor

### 8. Feature Binning
- Equal-width binning
- Equal-frequency binning
- Custom binning

## üí° Quick Examples

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
import pandas as pd

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# Encoding
encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoded_labels = encoder.fit_transform(categories)

# Handling missing values
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
imputed_data = imputer.fit_transform(data)
```
